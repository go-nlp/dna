# dna
A Deterministic Name Algebra-compatible repository to store all the definitions in various IDL files for data structures used throughout this organization.

In practice, this means that this is a repository of `.proto` and `.fbs` files in which one can pull and compose new protobuf and flatbuffer messages.


## Organization

All the IDL files will be stored in their specific directory corresponding to the package name. So the IDLs for `github.com/go-nlp/corpus` will be stored in the `corpus` subdirectory.
